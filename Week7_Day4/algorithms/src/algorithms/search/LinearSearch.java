/*
 * Linear Search is an search algorithm which locates the index of a target element
 * within a collection be comparing the target's value to each element of the collection
 * in sequential order.
 * 
 * This algorithm has a complexity of:
 * Time: O(n)
 * 		This algorithm always compares the target to each element, meaning this algorithm
 * 		can, at worst, complete a process for each element of the collection. At best it
 * 		can find the correct index in the first cycle.
 * 
 * Space: O(1)
 * 		Since this algorithm does not create any additional information
 * 		it has no additional space complexity.
