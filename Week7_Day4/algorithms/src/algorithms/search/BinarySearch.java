/* 
 * Binary Search is a search algorithm which finds an element by comparing a target element value
 * to a shifting "midpoint". This "midpoint" is based on the remaining search area, which is 
 * determined depending on the target number's value, as compared to the midpoint. A Binary search
 * only works on sorted collections. 
 * 
 * This algorithm has a complexity of:
 * Time: O(log n)
 * 		This algorithm reduces the search area by half during each cycle
 * 		so this algorithm is favored as you have increasingly larger collections.
 * 
 * Space: O(1)
 * 		Since this algorithm does not create any additional information
 * 		it has no additional space complexity.
